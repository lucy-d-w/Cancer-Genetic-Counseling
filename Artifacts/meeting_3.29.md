# Client Meeting:  3/29/2019

#### Team members:  Emily and Lucy
#### Goal:  review finished front-end

### General
* Backbone 3 only belongs in general path (ie. patient gives no indications in pre-survey)
* Progress bar on quiz questions with flag indicating progress.
* Use quarter instead of gold penny-looking coin.
* Husband doesn't matter for genetic testing, don't use children either. Change implications to an adult family, blood relations.
* Add past, present, and future on the last slide (email the 3 options). 
* Lock so that patient can't move on from you/family slide without clicking for more info. Advance to slide with text under each category. 
* Sound button next to quiz questions. 
* "Learning checkpoint" instead of "knowledge check"
* Curving lines instead of jagged for counselling process.
