# Client Meeting:  2/1/2019

#### Team members:  Emily and Lucy
#### Goal:  review wireframes

### General
* Dr. Pal is working on content tracks and survey questions to customize content
  * should be able to maintain a list of slides in each track, then render based on track
  * for some tracks a given slide may be a Backbone slide, and in others it may only be a Learn More
* want to embed quizes within relevant slides, as opposed to having the full quiz at the end
  * users will be allowed to scroll back and look at other slides to answer the questions
  * everyone will take every question, regardless of track
  * will require a database/a more robust backend
* would like to collect statistics on what users click on, and how they scroll through the site
* prefer to use square bullet points
* "learn more" buttons should be more specific so that patients know what they are learning more about

### Wireframe Slides

Backbone (BB) 3:
* content from sub-bullets on original slide should be available as a drop-down box
* add '+' to content boxes for drop-down menu

Learn More (LM) 4.1:
* change back to normal list layout

BB 5:
* add coin graphic/animation back in

LM 5.2:
* put text back on slide

BB 8:
* put arrow shapes back, like in original slide
* might add more cancer types to click on

LM 8.1, 8.2:
* add arrows back

BB 9:
* add graphics back
* add in new Learn More content

BB 10:
* add arrow back with +/- symbols

BB 11, 12:
* move "you" back above the circle, change wording to "For you..."

LM 12.1:
* need graphic with animation

BB 14:
* add "(GINA)" to the end of the title
* clients have edits for their own content for this slide
* change wording to "covers" and "does not cover"

BB 15:
* clients also have content changes for this slide

BB 16:
* add graphics

Closing slide:
* keep it generic, no contact info (may be used at many different clinics)
* handshake animation


### To-Do
* make layout changes to wireframes
* make plans for new backend structure
* investigate Firebase/other databse services
* look for library that can collect navigation statistics
* begin React Prototype
