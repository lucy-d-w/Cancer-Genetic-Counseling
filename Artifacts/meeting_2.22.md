# Client Meeting:  2/22/2019

#### Team members:  Emily and Lucy
#### Goal:  review webapp prototype and figure out HIPAA

### General
* They liked the colors and simplicity of the interface.
* Would prefer to click to the next slide instead of scroll down the page of all the information.
* Want to send users through link in RedCap survey. 

### HIPAA
* Solution that we settled on: Assign each individual a random authentication number. 
  * The doctors will know who has each number, so they will be able to match patients to quiz results.
  * RedCap might be able to send users to our web app with their authentication numbers so they will not have to enter it themselves.
